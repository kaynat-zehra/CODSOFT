#Simple Calculator
#Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display the result.

num1 = input("Please Enter the First number: ")
num2 = input("Please enter the Second number: ")
print('     operation       |       operator        ')
print('     addition        |          +        ')
print('   subtraction       |          -        ')
print('   multipication     |          *        ')
print('     division        |          /        ')
print('     remainder       |          %        ')
print()
operation = input("Please enter the operation to be performed: ")

if (operation == '+' or operation == "addition"):
    result = num1+num2
elif (operation == '-' or operation == "subtraction"):
    result = num1-num2
elif (operation == '*' or operation == "multiplication"):
    result = num1*num2
elif (operation == '/' or operation == "division"):
    result = num1/num2
elif (operation == '%' or operation == "remainder"):
    result = num1%num2

print("The result of the desired operation is: ", num1,operation, num2, "=", result)
